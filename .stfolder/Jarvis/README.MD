Jarvis AI Assistant Personal, evolving AI companion inspired by Iron Man's JARVIS. Built with your custom selfevolution engine, Whisper for voice input, and a slick wake-word from that GitHub clone-plus optional premium tweak where users pick their own trigger phrase. Runs threaded, never sleeps, learns you forever. ## What you get - Always-on mic listening (no hey spam) - Jarvis-or whatever you say-wakes it up - Transcribes, thinks via your selfevolution.py, replies out loud - Idle pings every forty-five seconds: Still here, sir. - Premium: type set wake word Phoenix and boom-it's yours ## Tools you need Python three-nine or later, VS Code (obviously), pip, git. That's it-no GPU magic unless you want speed. ## Step zero: grab 'em Open terminal in your project folder-run: bash git clone https://github.com/emre-guler/jarvis.git temp-jarvis cp temp-jarvis/src/voice/training/train_model.py . cp temp-jarvis/src/voice/wake_word_detector.py . rm -rf temp-jarvis (That rips just the wake bits-clean, quick.) ## Step one: install Drop this setup.py in root: python import subprocess, os pkgs = [openai-whisper, webrtcvad, pyaudio, numpy, TTS, tensorflow] for p in pkgs: subprocess.check_call([pip, install, p]) os.system(python -c 'import whisper; whisper.load_model(\base)') print(Loaded-your mic buddy is ready.) Run: python setup.py. Done in thirty seconds. ## Step two: the brain Make jarvis.py-paste what I gave earlier (threaded wake, command flow, your engine call). Hit save. ## VS Code trick Open folder, hit F-five to run without terminal clutter. Or add .vscode/launch.json: json { version: 0.2.0, configurations: [ { name: Jarvis Live, type: python, request: launch, program: jarvis.py, console: integratedTerminal, justMyCode: false } ] } F-five again-boom, it speaks. ## Training wake word (once) Record five Jarvis shouts: python train_model.py. Takes ten seconds-model learns your accent. ## Premium unlock Add top line: premium = input(Premium sub? y/n: ).lower() == y Then right under transcription: python if premium and set wake word in text: new_word = text.split(set wake word)[-1].strip() Thread(target=train_model, args=(new_word,)).start() Restart-now say set wake word Stark and it reboots on name. ## Kill switch Ctrl-C in terminal. It dies gracefully. No cleanup. ## Pro tip Want Stark suit sounds? Swap the TTS to tts_models/en/vctk/vits-gives accents. Or add LED blink on wake: Arduino blink code synced via serial-one GPIO pin. But hey-that's next weekend. Go build it. Tell me when it's running-I wanna hear you say Suit up.
